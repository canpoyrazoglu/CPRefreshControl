# CPRefreshControl
A customizable, UIView based refresh control to be used in conjugation with table views, collection views, or just about anything.

The code is self explanatory. Please not that this is *not* a drop-in replacement for `UIRefreshControl`. This control is to be used instead of `UIRefreshControl` where more adjustment parameters and freedom of using a regular `UIView` anywhere in view hierarchy are needed.
